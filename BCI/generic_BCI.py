    '''
    Implements a generic Brain-Computer Interface.

    Classification is continuously performed on the signal given in `inlet`, and at
    each classification, an `action` is performed.


    Arguments:
        inlet: a pylsl `StreamInlet` of the brain signal.
        classifier: a function which performs classification on the most recent data (transformed as needed). returns class.
        transformer: function which takes in the most recent data (`buffer`) and returns the transformed input the classifer expects.
        action: a function which takes in the classification, and performs some action.
        buffer_length(int): the length of the `buffer`; specifies the number of samples of the signal to keep for classification.
        n_channels(int): the number of channels in the signal.
